## Requirements

* Node.js>=12

## How to get it up and running

Clone this Git repository into somewhere, then proceed by installing
dependencies and building static assets and other TypeScript'y stuff:

```bash
$ npm install
$ npm run build
```

After that you can start the application with:

```bash
$ npm start
```

Which starts the backend HTTP server in port `3000`. You can change the default
port with `PORT` environment variable.
